            <h1>WHO ARE WE ?</h1>
            <p>The early beginnings of Basbaa Contracting and General Trading Office trace back to the 1970s under the leadership of its founder, Haj Ahmed Khamis Basbaa, and his sons.

Soon, the name of Ahmed and Rabee, sons of Khamis Basbaa, gained recognition and prominence in Hadhramaut, Aden, and across the provinces, specializing in constructing schools, hospitals, and government buildings. Their projects received accolades from international organizations for their contributions to education, health, and public works.  </p>
